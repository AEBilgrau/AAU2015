## PhD course in Aalborg

On **21-22 April 2015** Adrian Baddeley will give a two day PhD course
at Aalborg University titled *Analysing spatial point patterns with
R*. The course has a strong focus on hands-on exercises using the
comprehensive R package **spatstat**. No prior knowledge about spatial
statistics is required, but basic familiarity with R and ordinary
statistical concepts are needed.

### Course material:

The course is based on short blackboard lectures and software demonstrations followed by "lab"" exercises on the computer.

### Description:

Spatial point pattern datasets are becoming more common across many
fields of research. However, statistical methodology for analysing
these data has not been widely disseminated. This course is a
practical introduction to the analysis of spatial point patterns with
a strong focus on hands-on exercises throughout the course. The
course gives an in-depth introduction to spatstat, which is an
R-package for analysing spatial point patterns. The package supports
a complete statistical analysis of spatial point pattern data: data
input and inspection, calculations, plotting, exploratory data
analysis, hypothesis tests, model-fitting, simulation, Monte Carlo
methods and model diagnostics. The course will treat all these
subjects, and in particular the goals are for the participants to:

* Understand basic statistical concepts used in spatial point pattern
  analysis.
* Get an overview of the capabilities of spatstat and how to find your
  way around.  
* Learn how to conduct a basic analysis of a point pattern dataset:
    - Calculating and plotting exploratory summaries.
    - Fitting Poisson, Cox, and Gibbs point process models.
    - Validating and critiquing fitted models.
  
To obtain these goals we:

* begin with real examples and establish basic principles.
* introduce relevant graphical/exploratory methods
  including non-parametric intensity estimation, pair correlation, 
  Ripley's K-function.
* demonstrate model building, model-fitting, formal inference and
  model validation.

### Prerequisites

* Basic familiarity with R.
* Basic familiarity with statistical concepts.
* Please bring your own laptop, with the latest version of R and spatstat
  installed. Please ensure that all the 'Suggested' packages for spatstat 
  are also installed.
